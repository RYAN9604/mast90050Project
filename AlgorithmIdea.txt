Idea: Treat each location as a small problem.

1. Pick some ground, it may have say, 4 games.
2. Look at the games, from first to last (i.e. 10:00, 11:30, 1:00, 3:00) - get their categories.
3. Randomly match an umpire to the category (if no exact match look at close categories,
   (i.e. if no category B umps available look at C or A umps) if umpire has preference for two games 
   also put them in the next match (e.g. if assigned to 1:00 and also have preferences 
   for two games, also assign to 3:00). Fill up all matches, with at least two
   umpires per match. Remove used umpires from the set of available umpires. 
   Don't worry about if they don't exactly match category.
   - When assigning make sure that the assignment also meets hard constraints:
     . available times 
	 . Not assigned to own club
   
For the first grounds that are filled up, preferences should be met because all umpires 
are available. Towards the end preferences may not be as good because lots of umpires
already assigned.
IMPORTANT: ignore category E (boundary umpires). There are not many of them and they 
can easily be assigned once final solution is determined. They will generally go to 
category A games. 
Category A games can also have 3 umpires assigned to them. This may help in 
getting more umpires their preference of doing 2 matches. 
   
Should end with a pretty good initial solution. 

Rough objective function: Goal to minimise it.
. Constant penalty for not meeting preference of 2 games. 
. Very large penalty for umpire not being assigned at all - would prefer 
  to give umps with 2 game preference 1 game and have all umpires assigned 
  to at least one match. 
. Category penalty. If category matches no penalty. Smaller penalty for 
  category A umpiring lower category than lower category umpiring higher
  category. Also relative to distance between categories. (i.e. C umpiring A 
  is worse than C umpiring B).
